Motor Club of America (MCA) members are protected no matter what might happen to them on the road. With true unlimited roadside assistance, members can quickly get 24/7 help for car trouble or an accident and unlimited free towing to the nearest service facility. Should they receive a ticket, we are the only service with attorneys who will fight that ticket in court. Stranded far from home as the result of an accident? Weâ€™ll pay up to $500 for food, lodging or transportation.  MCA members are covered on Emergency Room visits and in-hospital stays resulting from a covered accident or, should the worst happen, a $10,000 accident death benefit.
